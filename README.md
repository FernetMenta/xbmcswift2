xbmcswift2
==========

A micro framework to enable rapid development of XBMC plugins.


## Features
* Run the addon from the command line *or* within XBMC without changing any
  code.
* Helper libraries to make common XBMC api operations easy, like adding items,
  getting settings, creating temporary files, etc.
* Handles all the url parsing involved in plugin routing. No need to deal with
  complicated URLs and query strings.


## Documentation

The current documentation can be found at http://www.xbmcswift.com

## Development

This project is under heavy development. This project is the next version of
xbmcswift. While the APIs are similar, there are a few things that are not
backwards compatible with the original version.
