   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to XBMC Swift's documentation!
======================================

Welcome to the documentation for xbmcswift. This documentation is divided into
several parts. If you are new, you should start with the :ref:`installation`
and then move on to :ref:`quickstart`. If you would prefer a more detailed
walkthrough, try the :ref:`tutorial`. For a list of everything, check out the
complete :ref:`api` reference. For more specific examples, check out
:ref:`patterns`. If you are upgrading from xbmcswift, check out the
:ref:`upgrading` page.

XBMC Swift doesn't rely on any external dependencies to get started. However,
when writing plugins I like to use <http://BeautifulSoup.org>. Also, when it
comes to advanced testing of plugins, I like to use <http://nosetests.org>.
